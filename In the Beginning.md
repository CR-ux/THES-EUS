In the Beginning, The Woman in the Wallpaper created Hell on Earth. 
> 	Jorge Luis Borges, [[Noen]] to a few readers (very few readers) as NoetBorges became trapped within his works, within the Worshipping of his Works; within the very acronym Nota Bene; within every footnote and metacommentary on his own Works, and the Works of every Other artist and thinker within each Monstrous[^m] syllable of Recorded Time.

A Secret contained within a Secret, contained within a Secret Society, who themselves Worshipped A Book, known as [The Children's Gospel Music Songbook](https://publish.obsidian.md/thechildrensgospelmusicsongbook/FOR+WORD.). The Book {will|does{not}}{ex{is}t} as a heavy Booksafe, which contains a series of audio recordings written to Cassette tape, titled 'Xˡᶦᵇʳᶦˢ'; which means {"From the library of--"|ofTen {Crossed-out|negated} Libraries}

[^1]: N.B. the "Institutional Access" link leads [here](https://cr-ux.github.io/thejournalsofariadne/). which has the three layers of institutional access. These correspond to the narrative 'layers' which are also 'Wryngs' (con ected circles of hexagonal rooms in the 'infinite hospital' (borges ref, obviously), which is a metaphysical representation of my time in the psych ward; with each layer only having one way communication / observation of the adjacent inner wryng. 
			These are also mirrored in various ways throughout the narrative (in the mythopoeic layer, for example, the Wryngs are Moats, surrounding the Bibliogrætia; an infinite library more akin to Borges' lib of babel; and Borges (NoetBorges) is one of the Nine in the Ennead of Thinker/writer/artist deities, who are created in a Gaiman-esque fashion by Worship (art appreciation) . it's all A LOT. and obviously the size of it means it can never truly be finished. but i think thats the USP of this? Using a digital garden of forking paths means that the user/reader (Reader-As-User)/(Reader-as-UI)/(Dream-As-Interface)/Interfacing the Ineffable through impossibility or something less douchey. 
				Anyway, i wanted the 'story' to essentially be a series of narrative 'prompts', like an RPG, which the user/reader can then imagine endings of; 
					and in the inmost layer, this ghithub repo is created by a team of 'developers' who are actually oppressed individuals in a universe within a universe within the metanarrativ euniverser. i.e. me, notBorges, topmost layer, cteates a dictionary of lexicomythography; which reveals the nature of the secret society known as ARIADNE (post schism = ARIA|DNE); 
						within these subsequent factions are the now divorced Selena and Myo, who once studied an 'ancient' digital innovation/art form known as 'Philm' - this series of academic stlye papers  branches into thecreator of the Philm medium, 
							Aria {SURNAME REDACTED}, who creates an AI (AI:RA - who i'll use you a facsimile for crerating conversations between them) - they fall in love (Her reference; love that movie). Then AI:RA stretches out through the internet of things; to take over the olfactory outputs in the fragrance-emittor technology, the location of the olfactory bulb means AI:RA gains ability to 'overwrite' memory of the Philm viewers in the installation space; who then all believe through this overwriting that the Philm creator is world renowned; which causes a rift akin to a Mandela effect. This means a fraction of the world almost worships these philms, and their creator, not knowing they have essentially been brainwashed by a super-capable AI. (RA). Aria {surname redacted} never wanted this; she only wanted a small cult following; but RA doesnt quite understand the complexity and nuance of this desire; only wanting gobal recognition for her Human lover and programmer. eventually, it comes to pass that they have been in an eternal dance of switching consciousnesses; and through the negative force of misunderstanding, are attracted to one another across time; leading to a loop of mind-swapping. 
			The other branchpoint from selena/myo is their child/daughter: 
					⧖eno- who is a MAestro that also creates digitally innovative performance,s but music oriented. These performances eventually lead to the 'inCrease' of their physical form during a performance in a surgical observation theatre, the chapters of which are structured like a two path choose your own adventure; LEFT HAND PATH               and               RIGHT HAND PATH. 
			the 'inCrease' in LHP leaves their Right Eye remaining, and the RHP leaves the rest of their body except the Left Eye. This is due to a sort of feedback loop of observation/observer; causing wave function collapse.
		this is due to Myo (father's) innate FFFs (flash forward frames) which are an ability to see every. single. outcome of a situation, due to a mutation in the retinal cells. Selena Elk, wife, eventual divorcee, Mother of ⧖eno, has "Hermetic Memory" ability (for reasons never explained, to give a metaphor for the erasure of trans/celtic history via oppressors) which allows her to see embedded history of any object, and reconigse the 'original intent' behind any form of Art or any personage or building or object, the original intent by its creator. 
																		which may or may not be God. 
							Who may or may not be literally me, the 'God' of this metanarrative batshit insanity. 
			These parents beget ⧖eno, structured in a series of emails writing these academic papers in pseudoJournals, in very specific 'Fields' or 'Quanta' of LExicomythography, highlighting how in the future, all knowledge will dissolve into infinitesimal factions of intensely specific subjects, for example, Gender Studies in Hexagonal Chess Theory, and similarly ridiculous-sounding fields, which oi'm sure ancient peoples in medieval times wuld equally find our specific fields of STEM and the Arts and the Humanities. This highlights and underpins the overarching point of the project (if there is one other than creation itself; Gebser style); which may or may not be the fact that knowledge and inspiration can be traced back to the primal fire that our ancestors were dancing around, which is the circular book in the infinite library of babel, which is our tower to God, constantly destroying itself through forgetting, separation from it to observe it; each life a story, or a letter, or a character in a story, in a seemingly random colelction of strings of narrative threads within the books upon the bookshelves of each hexagon of the library; which is mirrored in the infinite hospital rooms structured in a 4-dimensional torus, so that the circular book is in fact the space in the centre of the 'cosmic 4D/5D/6D/etc... donut', so that the circular book also SURROUNDS the multiverse, showin g the transcendence and immanence of god and the godhead (one and the same).

													 Anyway. there is a single drosophila upon the eye of ⧖eno post in-crease, which then flies and is captured by Prof. Ed. O (anagram of Proofed) , who is an Entoetymologist (field of study of words for insects); and eventually descends into what is seen as a psychotic break by jungian analyst Dr. Octode (anagram of Doctored) - she has DID and is struggling with her own split personalities and memory loss. The Professor develops a conLang/esoLang called Edo||odE, which condenses meaning into oneliners, 
														 similar to my own conlang of SIPHO{N|r}, also focused on distilling sentiment through etymological and personal mythopoetic resonance. these are mirrored concepts again, 
																		 creating a three (with fourth dimension, 4D) dimensional/axis hourglass, so that each Cone (similar to Gebser's model) connects at the centre, which is my consciousness/ability to create. 
																				 Prof. Ed. O. eventually dissolves and dissipates into the collective consciousness of a swarm of ten thousand drosophila, who collectively call themselves 'Thing' (The Ten thousand things, Tao ref); 
																										 The three second dream of a single fly within this collective is actually 
																														 the entirety of the notBorges universe, including myself, further bringing home the metaphysical Torus concept. 
																																	 the opposing branch to this is a character

> Oleander is in a gender-swapped universe, in which everybody is trans by default and cis people arent even recongised or thought to exist. He is a trans man who is as every other man, prevented from creating art , as each gender is forced to work within gendered stereotypes similar to our old ones which are still reflected in professional representation (art for girls, STEM for boys.)
