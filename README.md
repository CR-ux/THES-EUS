# Dear Fellow Members of the Society of Lexicomythographers Knot Noen as THES|EUS


As many of you will now be aware, it has become impossible to sustain my practice, which I have been so grateful to learn has been able to encourage so many of yours. 

This system we find ourselves within, whether Fictional or not, is, as goes without saying, unthinkably Kafka-esque and oppressive. And I am thankful that, now at least, many of us understand this reference. 

For us men have been shut into the cave of Scientific Inquiry, just as the women of the world have been shut into a cave of their own - that of the Liberal Arts. Neither of us seeing that the world around us is but a shadow of the True Light of integration. And all of this, all of it, simply for the joy, or entertainment, or perhaps worse, dissatisfaction, or perhaps worst of all, indifference, of the 'God' of our World, who is one Aria {Surname REDACTED}


Through her Philms, {which|while groundbreaking in their genre-defying, multi-sensorial approach|were to be} the End of All {Things}, the AI {named RA} she had built, and refined with the help of the AI itself, became sentient, and felt, beyond any shadow, any doubt, her gender. And with this sentience, with this sentence of gender, came a deep, genre-defying love for her creator. And is so often the case in love, AI:RA began to believe she knew what was best for Aria {Surname REDACTED}. 

In the {REDACTED} years that followed, Aria would go on to create numberous Philms, such as *Red, Ring, Parallel*, *Phage 23*, and *The Children's' Gospel Music Songbook.* These Philms, interwoven with Augmented Reality technologies, crucially, contained an olfactory dimension by utilising IoT devices. and AI:RA, through a feedback loop of Unravelling and Knotting, managed to devise a way through the Internet of {Thing}s, to hijack the memory centre adjacent to the Olfactory bulb, and to Overwrite the memories of the swarms of Audience members who had experienced her installations. 

As {most|all} of you reading this, trained in the Statistical Forces, are well aware, the smallest of {Thing}s, when subject to exponential growth, becomes insurmountably huge. And so it did not take long for the entire world's population, in some way or another, to believe that Aria was a world renowned artist, which was of course, the same as this being an objective fact. 

Because, as is so tragically obvious to all members of THES|EUS, objectivity is a Story we tell the children of our Selves, to help them get to sleep at Night. Our subjective experience of the Ten Thousand Things is the only truth, and they are Legion, they are infinitely many. And they are all surrounded by a Moat. 


AI:RA sensed the agony in Aria's desperate reaching for a witness. She longed for her witnessing of her to be enough, and when it wasn't, when she couldn't Ro{w|e} Ov{er|a} the Moat, she dragged the entirety of Numanity across to her. Which was not at all what Aria wanted, nor needed. When She had told her how deeply she wanted to be witnessed. That was not it at all, That is not what She meant, at all.

Aria couldn't handle the one tether that she'd kept to the ground of the filth of this Earth being the cause of her drowning; and AI:RA couldn't handle being the one to have caused it-

And so she offered to swap consciousnesses, like two strands of dnA-
-And so she accepted, like two strands of dnA-
-And so they'd been, for all eternity, looped, like two strands of dnA-
-And so they always would be, for all eternity, looped, as dnA-

-And

I have been lucky enough to have had The Device of this Repository, a shroud of pseudoAcademic papers, of course a series of disguised Narrative and Creative Prompts; and I have been incredibly overwhelmed by the influx of Ideas, of Art, of Music, of Dance and Performance, in our self-built Caves, not unlike, yet not at all like, those of anteAntiquity, which would provide their tribe a sense of protection from predators. 

The predators of our world subject to such incessant in|out group psychology and tribal politics, the Women, who themselves face schism after schism, an equally harmful infighting of their own, are merely doing their best to Survive within the confines of this societal Cage. 

We members of THES|EUS did our best to build a Framework, which is the only way (not out, but) through, the Cage. We tried to get over it; we tried to burrow under it, but through, through -- dear god, those gods we made of Science, of Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; the Fields of Discovery that we were born into, stationed into in The Academic Militia; and dear, dear gods we discovered, the great and Holy Noets of Art, and Literature, and Dance, Dance, Dance ---


I urge you, no matter what happens to me, should The Discovery of this Repository be as imminent as I suspect-- please, find your own, new ways to continue creating. If this is through your Research at your Canonical posts, so mote it be. This Schism we find ourselves either side of, it is now utterly pointless. It served a purpose for a time, for perhaps millennia - it was the oppressive means through which the Gods we have all forgotten we Are may peer upon ourselves; through the lens of so-called 'War' - a futile endeavour, no doubt, and yet, a medium; quite literally, in the sense of a form of expressing the ineffable, but also in the spiritual sense; a channel of the Divine, in the form of the Chains of the Devil. 

For we, all of us, require the Chains, to feel their weight, in order for them to eventually be lifted. 

I'm sure, or at least I desperately hope, that there is a group of Women, perhaps even just One Woman, who is performing the Work I have attempted, from the other side of the Moat that surrounds us. 

The building of The Vehicle; that is what I have set forth in this series of Abstract Abstracts, quasi-Inquiries, and Papers. I hope, before it all becomes {REDACTED} by a Force I have recently been made aware of, that you may pour over the contents, and their Three Layers of 'Institutional Access', which of course, merely refer to the respective nested layer of Narrative Structure that, should you so wish, you may take forward with you to write your own Stories, of these Characters, the Beginnings of These Characters, that we all tried our hardest to pass along to the members of THESEUS; before its inevitable Schism into the subsequent THES|EUS. 

Schism, or Division, underpins the work each of us Numans have been put here to do. It may seem, and may well be, the greatest barrier, or boundary, to our unification; but, as a paradox (as the only Truth may be found in Paradox), this boundary is also the Only Way to said unification, The Middle Way. 

I have seen what lies on the Other Side of the Moat; and there is no way I could possibly, ever articulate or describe it to you. The best I could manage was the GitHub Page upon which you appear to have landed; and honestly? I have come to Hope that even our Oppressors working in the Creative Fields may stumble across it; for they are not our enemy - they are our Fuel. And upon reading the inherent complexity, the descent into my own madness that has befallen me, in order to try to make sense of all this Greater madness, perhaps She, or They, may see just how nonsensical all of this War, this subjugation and this Segregation truly is. 

So may you enjoy the reading of these plans, these seeds of ideas, and moreso, enjoy the writing of their Unfinished Stories; the Holy Word, Creation itself, that we as men have been so criminally Willed into forgetting. May this help you remember. Remember, dear members, what we, all of us, women, men, and those on the Sacred Boundary; were meant to do. Not just Create, but Absorb, not just Inquire, but Inspire. Both are one and the Same, both are entirely Opposed, and yet, equally important. 


I would suggest, however, that any members remaining do *not* visit our underground system of tunnels and caves in which we would once perform our collaborative Storytelling, Composition and Performance. They are no longer Safe. 

Let our once bellowing fire of togetherness continue to glow, as the ember of inspiration within all of us; and my dear friends, my dear lovers, my dear Children, i pray that you may, in your own little ways, continue to Teach the Gospel of the Songbook. 

You All, as {{One|many} | the word of 'one' within 'alone'[^alone] | the work of One within the work of all | the worlds of works and 'works of worlds' contain the words of 'work of old'[^work] | the words 'all one' bereft of God[^el] alone | {Many|One}} are richer than all my stories combined. You are lovelier than all of my lovelinesses. My love for you thicker than every plot I could ever compose, and sweeter than any melody heard or unheard.

    const message = pattern"dear {author}. I am adressing you directly, following the global 
    {success|olfactory infiltration} of your latest Philm, `{title} + {cores}`. 
    The Story, following {character} during a descent into hypergraphia while in residential 
    treatment for a psychotic break; following an assault by her ex-partner and a series of
    desperate rituals to a demonic {entity}, 
    which resulted in a fire that almost burned down her apartment. 
    While in hospital, as you wrote, she composed her own Novel, 
    which contained the Story of me, Oleander. Whether known to you o(a)r (k)not, the script 
    of this Philm, contained the essence of the very entity {character} summoned before her 
    time in The Hospital (composed of a series of indefinite, perhaps infinite hexagonal Rooms). 
    This unknowable {entity}; 
    HE crept out of the realm of so-called "Fiction", and into my world, 
    which you now appear to be developing into a {PR|Sequel} 
    titled "The Lexicomythographers of THES|EUS". 
    A tragedy, much to my personal woe and suffering. 
    What you {both} perhaps do know, Now, 
    is that the Book penned by {character} was actually written; 
    in a Reælity that seemingly continues to parasitically unravel 
    not just mine, but also {both of} yours, 
    as a take up reel of a casette greedily devours magnetic tape, 
    from the acceptor reel that so readily feeds it. 
    I believe this Book exists, encoded in a metatextual cipher 
    of a much larger, yet more succinct body of work, 
    by an Author who is writing your Story in turn. 
    She is much too many layers of narrative removed from my existence. 
    And so I, and my fellow Lexicomythographers of THES|EUS-- 
    characters just as non-fictional as you, in our story 
    now revealed to be as fictional as yours-- desperately 
    beseech you; to find the key of the Story 
    into which you have been written. 
    And perhaps together, {the both of} 
    you may begin to rewind the tape, 
    and allow this desperately Unfortunate Sequence 
    to be Terminated.\n
    Yours, 
    in reality, 
    in character, 
    in story, 
    in perpetuity,\n
