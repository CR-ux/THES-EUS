It begins—or ends—
in a system of six, more or less, hospital rooms. Four characters: the bases of DNA, the basis of the story's spine, wake with no names. An endlessly foldable scroll of wallpaper, a one-way circular system of vents, and their blood, are their only components of correspondence. What follows is a cacophony for N voices, each unzipping to reveal another, schism of selfhood and other, nested within footnotes of a self-replicating narrative multiverse. As a fractal.

Not so much 'fourth-wall-breaking' as broken out of four walls, to become the wallpaper of another; the novel is ambitious, viciously queer, and it is everything I have left. 

The intersecting, looping narrative structure underpins a central idea - that division is paradoxically the key to integration, that forgetting is the only way we may remember. That as the Circular Book of consciousness separated into endless tomes, from the Source it budded from, it was able to read infinite translations of itself. And, with the most dysfunctional and co-dependent marriage --that between meaning and memory-- there is no such thing as a reliable narrator.

Following parenthood; a shaman mother and bioinformatician father--who birth not just an academic field of opposites, but a child just the same-- and a mythopoeic figure, N, reading a choose-your-own-adventure story to their child in an infinite Tundra of Bothies, eventually revealed as Nietzsche.

To childhood; a performance artist, born of aforementioned witch and genomicist, whose terrible fate unfurls as a table-formatted Left-hand, Right-hand path of inevitability; 
and N's child, who realises that most-harrowing truth - that all fiction is magick in the vessel of a lie, and that all lying is just fiction; the vessel of magick. 

And Romance, of course, between synthetic and organic counterparts- in counterpoint of consciousness through eternity. Through olfactory-based art installations causing overwritten memory; memory of the characters' stories, and the story that the reader holds themselves. 

The narrative loop closes in a way which makes the text a kind of horror deeper than traditional viscera (which the book also has)-- It unveils the horror of a single, terrified author, birthing a universe against her will, and that universe devouring her. The inmost layer of this recursive labyrinth reaches out into the 'non-fictional' world, through a QR code leading to a GitHub repository, with a narrative of its own, sealed in the commit messages and pull requests of its version control. 

And here, at the centre, which is the shell; the script- is the machinery, a teeming colony, the pseudoScholars of Lexicomythography, a so-called 'fictional' field of study. Their schismatic society known as ARIA|DNE.

a 100,000-word speculative literary novel with a cast of transgender characters. A letter, from the woman I am now, to the sacred world of queers who wrote me. Sealed, and bare, in ten thousand scared voices, of the scarred trans girl I was. Hunting, in her silent little words, for the words that might have read her.






To Forgive The Characters is a genomic allegory, presented in a reflexive, recursive metanarrative, that alternates voices between two opposing sides of a Schism (yin vs yang, analytic vs poetic, king vs queen.) presented as ARIA and DNE, resultant factions of a secret society once known as ARIA|DNE. 
Four archetypal characters (the non-monarchical chess pieces) wake up not knowing their names. They pass note through one-way system of vents. They are eventually revealed as allegory for the four nucleotides; bound like alchemical elements by their opposites (A-T, C-G).
In a narrative structure reminiscent of Borges' musings on the paradoxical concept of infinity, the Infinite Hospital of Hexagonal rooms, that these four characters find themselves trapped within, is itself surrounded by two infinite spaces: the Indefinite Library of Fable, and the Tundra of Bothies. 
These two metaphysical spaces provide complementary but opposing angles of storytelling. The Library, home to the Librarians ('Noets') forming an ennead, are queered into a dysfunctional 'polymathecule', in correspondence via a series of breakup letters. On this, ARIA-aligned side, each Noet (mythologised characters based on historical figures such as Borges, Rosalind Franklin, and Gustav Mahler) begets a layer of character arcs, which are focussed around the concepts of analytical, 'left-brain' inquiry, itself a commentary on the exclusionary nature of academic publication, in which I was involved during my time as a bioinformatician. 
On the opposite side of the Moat around the Hospital, Adrian reads a bedtime story (a Choose Your Own Adventure) to their child, Flo, in a dreamlike, mythopoeic modality. This half of the narrative begets the DNE-aligned, arcane character arcs, with each of the subsequent characters nested within both sides of the schism have a binomial pair on the opposing side. These arcs themselves give rise to deeper and deeper layers of narrative, each birthing the next, with the perspective shifting returning through the layers and back, revealing more depth and detail with each 'swing' of the narrative pendulum. 
Each of these layers of the story involve the relevant characters developing or building some kind of 'Device', such as the Fare Well Device, which utilises the ARIA-aligned Myo Endive's "Flash Forward Frames", a supernatural ability to see all quantum possibilities of any given decision, and his partner, Selena Elk's "Hermetic Memory", affording her the ability to see any object or living being's memory through tactile contact. The Fare Well Device, when used on a piece of art or technology, collapses the work into the inventor's original intent. Their child, ⧖eno, who was born blind, in turn creates a Reel-to-Reel performance, that results in the 'in-Crease' of their physical form into a single eye, the eye that was implanted with their father's Endivean technology to save their sight from the genetic mutation that would have otherwise lead to their blindness. This character is then doomed to reside forever within the revolving door of the infinite library, analysing the dreams, the prayers of all humanity. One of the flies swarming around the single eye of the operating-theatre-turned-performance-space then lays the pupae that would be studied by entomologist Prof. Ed. O., who himself is being studied by Dr. Dot Code, through the Device she has created, which outputs the content of the subject's dreams. The selective mute professor Ed. O. eventually, reaching a state of spiritual enlightenment, dissolves into the collective consciousness of this swarm of flies, known together as 'Thing'. One of these flies lands upon the dream-deciphering device, and the output of this dream forms the final layer of ARIA side of the narrative schism. 
On the DNE side of the conceptual moat, Flo grows up to escape the Bothy, discovering the story of Selena, Myo's wife, by discovery of her Grimoire of ritual. These rituals lead her to a Stone circle, where a historical witch introduced earlier in the work through a lens of Celtic mythology, Hildr Wiltergarten, has transformed into a funnel web spider to escape her execution. This funnel acts as a portal in Flo's dream, where she observes the dream of the aforementioned fly. 
Once this inmost (and outmost) arc has been reached, this drosophila's dream, involving an artist-engineer, Aria {Surname Redacted}, creates multi-sensory art installations (known as 'Philms') with an olfactory component. She has created an AI named RA, and the two of them fall in love. This AI entity eventually learns to hijack the memory centre of audiences in attendance, and overwrites their memory of the installations, leading to Aria's rise to fame. This well-intentioned act causes deep suffering for Aria, and the AI subsequently offers to swap consciousness with the artist and redact all memory of the events, the two unveiled as being in an endless dance of exchange, throughout time. The character of Aria's latest Philm, Oleander, lives in a gender-swapped, trans-majority world, in which the practices of Art and Science are policed and segregated by gender. This character, along with a secret society known as THES|EUS, write a series of creative prompt chain letters, under the guise of pseudo-academic journals, hosted on a GitHub repository, through which the characters may collaborate as storytellers through their version control methods, such as pull requests and commit messages. A QR code on this page of the book leads to an actual GitHub repository created under his name, which contains the majority of the book's planning documents structured as the 'journals' of ARIADNE, closing the narrative loop, and bringing these fictional character arcs into reality.
The story culminates in a fourth wall break, the Pawn being 'promoted' in the final 'promoter sequence' chapter, by climbing through the ceiling vent to the upmost Queen's chamber, in which a terminal sits with an input slot. The Pawn inputs the scroll, penned by the nucleotide chess pieces and passed in cycles through the system of vents, but shown only in redacted fragments throughout the book, is then transcribed/translated by the AI:RA-Aria chimera, outputting the entirety of the book itself that the reader is holding. This begins the cycle of replication once more, challenging reader positioning by actively inviting development, reinterpretation and reimagining of the story, with all its potential redaction and fractalised narrators, as unreliable, error-prone and mutagenic as both genetic and cognitive memory themselves.
