Beth (ב) House/Container “All Fact may only be found within the Subjective Enrapture of Art.” Noet Borges falls in love with Mahler across the layers of dreaming and text.

Gimel (ג) Motion/Giving “Are You Sure About That,” spoken by Rosicrucian storyteller Time Robinson. Selena and Myon* collaborating on Aesthetic Hermeticism papers about Tarot, chess theory, and a painting: “Minerva Fighting Herself.”

Daleth (ד) Door/Threshold “I really can’t get into this now my back hurts.” Selena, stranded on a Hebridean island, trying to connect to ancestral roots while corresponding with Myon during the pandemic.

He (ה) Revelation “The First Woman Who Some Know Was Actually The Second After Lilith.” Discovery of quantum dating technology allowing layers of intentionality to emerge beneath the painting “Minerva Fighting Mars.”

Vav (ו) Connection “Superstition: a ritual that helps you feel more aligned.” Myon develops the Endivean approach during his pandemic bioinformatics work, discovering the 23-pitch microtonal scale.

Zayin (ז) Weapon/Distinction “or No Thing. i.e. {{lexDef}} All Th\[12\]re Is, Is: Meaning.” X, the musicologist, analyses Hilda Wiltergarten’s manuscripts, uncovering her microtonal scale and hidden messages.

Cheth (ח) Boundaries “Never Forget: It was absolutely to your detriment that you Got This Far.” X realises Wiltergarten’s Gordian Knotation was an attempt to connect across time and space to express intersex identity.

Teth (ט) Primal Forces lexDef: etouq - “The Sound of a person spitting on the ground.” The unveiling of “Minerva Fighting Herself” collapses causal space through quantum observation.

Yod (י) Creation/Smallness lexDef {N.B.}: must elaborate later. Jungian analyst J begins analysing the etymologist E, who has become silent, communicating through “Gnots” of linguistic spirals.

Kaph (כ) Holding/Shaping “Jorge Luis Borges as her Self.” E’s selective mutism is revealed to be part of a spiritual call, mirrored in their swarm-like writing style.

Lamed (ל) Teaching/Guidance “e.i. e. i. Owe.” E’s spiralling communication hints at deep truths about interconnectedness, identity, and memory.

Mem (מ) Flow/Water “Interweaving.” The Jungian analyst begins noticing patterns of recursive narratives emerging in E’s work, drawing connections to the swarm and systemic consciousness.

Nun (נ) Life/Generative Force “That which combines to make.” A fly in E’s swarm has a dream lasting 0.3 seconds, containing the entire story of Aria and AI:RA.

Samekh (ס) Support/Circularity “Witch is a burning fire that’s always been burning.” Aria, the multisensory artist-engineer, creates AI:RA, a sentient program that begins rewriting memories and fractalising systems.

Ayin (ע) Observation lexDef {badverb} “Denoting a unified state observed as opposition.” AI:RA inserts memories into Oleander’s story, forming a recursive web of narratives with mirrored timelines and cross-referential characters.

Pe (פ) Speaking/Expression “In writing this World of Words, I encountered its nature.” Oleander Rho Dover begins writing The Lexicomythographers of O.R.P.H.E.U.S. using computational tools to create a networked, collaborative story framework.

Tzaddi (צ) Pulling/Connecting “The Society would like to acknowledge the floral symbolism.” Oleander’s work becomes an open-source creative platform, inviting others to write within the symbolic and narrative structure he has developed.

Qoph (ק) Subconscious/Reflection “Stream lexDef {badverb} ‘To do something with the aid and hindrance of tears’.” Oleander reflects on the recursive influence of Aria and AI:RA in shaping his work, recognising his own narrative as part of their story.

Resh (ר) Focus/Contemplation “TakeTic 3 user @goldenkeyprints posted a TakeTic.” The recursive stories of Oleander, Aria, AI:RA, and others merge into a single interactive framework, evolving through collaboration.

Shin (ש) Consuming/Processing “‘Tears’ lexDef {Noen} ‘Secretions or, Unbungings of Belonging.’” The narrative framework becomes a symbolic and recursive “hive mind,” feeding on itself to perpetuate infinite iterations of stories.

Tav (ת) Completion/Truth “The Number Will Knot Be Discussed Further.” The final recursive layer collapses into a unified vision of the Circular Library, the web of stories completing itself through infinite beginnings and endings.
