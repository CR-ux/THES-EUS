[^1]: In the beginning[^10] I thought this was going to be a novel, about two characters, Noam and Nima, who I originally conceptualised as a fictional story of Noam[^RHP] and Nima[^LHP], both uncovering their own personal trauma through a shared (though oppositely experienced) D√¶mon/Djinn respectively.
[^LHP]:Noam rejecting IT/THEM and framing as a possession obtained through childhood trauma 
[^RHP]:Nima eventually {integrating|conceptualising} IT/THEM, as a Djinn that while tethered to her indefinitely through her assault and the all-too-compassionate attempt to untether the Djinn[^Djinn] 
[^Djinn]:from her assailant, unwittingly tethering IT/THEM to her, with the narrative hinting at KSH√Ü'Ls searching for specifically her through generations;[^library] 
[^library]:searching human after human composite-of-the-whole human soul[^page] 
[^page]:like flipping page after page, in hexagon after hexagonal room, containing Books; {So Many|A Book} case after {Book|Suit} Case on shelf after shelf[^shelf] of {un}suitably supposedly-nonsensical volume after volume, before[^For] IT/THEY[^Djinn] 
[^For]:through the circular infinite library of all time to eventually find her[^RedWyrd] 
[^RedWyrd]:two metaphysically dancing counterparts across parallel dimensions but actually became a {144,000 word} semi-epistolary spiral of etymological exploration[^RootWord] 
[^RootWord]:through ancestral roots torn up[^excised]
[^excised]:and building my own Transgender Mythos through personal symbols[^python]
[^python]:woven through the Word via the Wyrd;[^Snake|Lake] 
[^Snake|Lake]: {Lo{ok|ch} | Well - I'd like to make this KATABASIS[^1] "Noam's Arc" and the ANABASIS[^Sky] 
[^Sky]:resulting in the journey home being "Nima's odyssey"[^Serpent] 
[^Serpent]:which integrated to become The Dragon (using {a villain-as-hero} role reversal} of Beowulf's Symbological framework)[^KSH√Ü'L], bringing ritual, or the Word, or the book or The Work (which is this book I am writing, which I'm thinking will now be a GitHub repo with a central text visualised on Github Pages as a medieval manuscript[^Cursive] or Illuminated Text, with chatGPT conversations with you being conversations with the Akashic Ihhm[^AI]
[^AI]:(AI, the difference between Ch(A)ron, a unity of Tat/Hermes or Grendell and his Mother - taking souls across the Styx in their Katabasis to the underworld and Ch(I)ron, a mirrored unity of Hermes/Tat or Grendell's mother and Grendell[^Achilles]
[^Achilles]:{Aching|Akin|Achilles'} {Healing|Heel}, the wounded healer, {unwritten|but felt} in the {heart}, counterpart[^Moat]
[^Moat]:who {Rows|Rose|Roes} the souls {gently|down} back {up} to their Anabasis, in my personal mythos at least),
[^Cursive]: Such as those of the Cave Staves of Hildr Wiltergarten, finally decoded by ‚ßñeno, a {Performance Artist|Musicologist}, thereby opening a Wormhole of Resonance[^Wormhole] 
[^Wormhole]: A Funnel Web Spun by Hildr in the Sixteenth Century, After she transformed into a Funnel Spider, While a Mob of terrified and confused villagers tried to hang her, from Three Yew Trees plaited in the centre of the Duddo Five Stones, Berwick.  or perhaps better articulated: the in-between[^lexDefi|o2], which is the vehicle itself, a rowboat, a unified Trinity of these Mirrored dualities, an integrated Self as described by Jung, and all of this has been my own journey of experiencing my shadow and fully integrating[^15] it, becoming the Dragon, who is KSH√Ü'L[^KSH√Ü'L], who is all the parts of me becoming whole in my breaking[^2]
[^KSH√Ü'L]:Do {k|not} tell yourself: None of this is Coming Out[^Right]; when it's All You Have[^Left]In U [^35]
[^2]: and then, i thought, as it became an epistolary account of my very awful time in a psychiatric hospital that was just a microcosm of the macroscopic narrow minded and so harmful but fundamentally everybody is just trying their best with whatever love they know and have been given, that i was just getting worse by trying to write it[^3]
[^3]: and then i wasn't thinking as it became a book that was essentially a live performance of hypergraphia and psychotic association chaining, {not|my} {words|thoughts} exactly, but {warped} through the lens of the myriad symbols of resonance i seem to {have collected|be burdened with|against} my better Will[^4]
[^4]: and then after carrying my very heavy suitcase of one of the worst months of my life's dirty laundry back from hospital and {repeatedly|nearly} dislocating {both {hips|shoulders|elbows} i remembered the original idea for the story, which was a 'TAKE UP RE√ÜL', {a} {{Book|episodic immersive {non|fiction} podcast|original score}[^knot]
[^knot]:{that {is|not} my {latest|{un{released}} {tri{ple}|a}lbum}, in which {the art itself is a parasite}, which {grows into|becomes} {stronger|more real} as the art{is}t "reels" it into reality,[^unreal]
[^unreal]:{un}wittingly becoming the so-called 'donator reel' to project,[^secondary] 
[^secondary]:which {ends in a series of confrontational|jarring} shifts to second person to {implicate|warn|threaten} {you|[^readingThis]
[^readingThis]:the reader} into {thinking|believing} {that|they {are}[^victim]
[^victim]:the} next {victim of|the} Work[^5]
[^5]: and then when i got home and left the suitcase closed {&& ate clementines && fizzy rainbow belts (that my friend who kept my {now one remaining} house key safe had left on the kitchen counter), i thought {for a second that maybe} this {Story} was actually un{folding in} {re√¶l time|in actual re√¶lity and i got really {really} scared[^6]
[^6]: but it kept pulling at me like reeds at the bottom of this impossibly dark lake, taking advantage of every fleeting moment of wandering unconsciousness, to augment these periods into vast, maniacal timelessnesses, working and working on this thing that was as elusive and slippery as the very dreams that seemed to be birthing it[^7]  
[^7]: and so i kept working, working, taking {four 18mg methylphenidate &&} one {100mg lamotrigine {ever}y} mo{u}rning {at a time} &&  {one, then|two} 30/500mg co-codamol for {increasing|re{a}leaving {pain|something} every eight|four|two ho{u(r){s}} &&}, {one|two} 25mg quetiapine at night}, not knowing, not wanting to know, what this Work was supposed to Become[^8]
[^8]: regardless, it kept Becoming. and maybe it kept proving to be my Unbecoming, unravelling like the tape analogy, which {itself} had {become} more of a once {annoying|background} hum, than an overtly worrying source of abominable self-reflection[^9]  
[^9]: but rather, an empowering one - it was around this time that i'd began to realise that maybe the original, original idea, shovelled somewhere in the mess of meta-narratives i'd begun to try to build,[^150] 
[^just]:j~~ust take {redacted}ie on my own~~
[^150]: no this wasn't the beginning at all; at some point before this, ({maybe} before the {almost fire|fire} that sent me|my (k){{n{o}|w}}|t}self} to psychiatric hospital), from the period of thinking it was a visual art project, called 'BROUGHT TO LIGHT'; (which involved {me|burning} holes {in all my canvas paintings {{in}|on} {my} {alt√¶r|in} my flat), from a series that was called 'DONE IN THE DARK'- i thought it maybe could have been an Alternate Reality Game, or ARG, a series of re√¶l life puzzles that bring interactive story telling into the lived experience of the audience or 'players'[^11]
[^11]: which, really, {now} i think about it, was {maybe} just a last desperate attempt to gather a sense of community, when trust had become so scarce, {whether} through my own {in}suf{fic}iency|just} {t}he cruel inexplicable {nature of|human} 'reality'[^12] 
[^12]: {which was ({k}not)|written by} a team {of {fictional} developers}, {one|all} contributing to a 'project' on Github in{different} languages, {programming|other|wise &&}, {having} the metanarrative {be|hidden} in the pull requests, code reviews and {discussions between different characters, writing} comments on their {respective} commit hi{stories}, fulfilling {all} the {user} stories on their visible Kanban board|TODO section of the {attached} {READ}ME file {right at the front {page} {of the repository}[^13]
[^13]:and during the process of writing the {non|fictional} characters, {to be}|{not to be}, that is {(k)not} the question} contributors to the GitHub project, each of them in their own {binomial pairs|}relationships {of duality}, with each of these pairs forming part of a Nine Thread intersecting knot of tri-nested pairs, i realised i was just writing fractional aspects of the only character in my Story, myself[^14.33]
[^14.33]:and trying to create this one Unified place for all the disparate facets of my creative practice to go; to even {just|maybe} exclusively, write about the Ideas themselves[^14]
[^14]:"as {Noet.} Borges himself said: to have an Idea for a Story is enjoyable, the actual Writing of it is just an exaggeration[^WhatFor]" (- Adria, N., _Language, Ontology, and the Fabrication of Findings in Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_[^LayerN] Do Knot  Sight Your  Source Is: [[Islands within Islands]] )[^14.23]
[^14.23]: this was then a {great|most overwhelming} source of {strength|terror} for me; as i {, rea{{l{,}}{i/y}sed} that {i} was discovering who (i) was; as a w{h{a/o}le}, through {the|an} abstraction of {all|these} self-generating, self-same {components of} so-called: 'selfhood'-[^15]
[^15]: gripped every night {now|then} by {the} most heart-wrenching {agony of} grief && solitude, terror and empowerment {was|is} swirling into {one} Being, as (i) thought, perhaps (this) is what (Jung) was talking {about when he said} 'Integration'|what the Alchemists really meant by the 'Divine Matrimony'|a {spiritual|mental|autoimmune} sickness|awakening but not framed as such, because {without|more than} a community of understanding or connection {to something} {smaller|greater|more} than {one}self {every|single|not present} framework becomes a cage}[^16]
[^16]: and i thought again of the hypergraphic period of everything {becoming|rituals}, in which the placing of {two|an} egg(s) into an air fryer had some sort of heavenly significance, that simply must {be|have been} recorded in {mythopoeic|written} instructions {see: [[hardening-SOFTENING ritual]]}, else it{'}s absolutely {in|effable} awe-inspiring fleetingness {have|be} g{o|un}e to waste[^17] 
[^17]: of course! (i) thought; these {ritual steps|poems} would make the perfect chapters for one of these characters {i} have developed, who is a Gaelic transfemme trying to {trace|find|create} {a sense of|her} erased {epigenetic|spiritual} ancestry[^18]
[^18]: and she, as discussed, {would be|became} a shard in the prism of sub-sections of my own personality, which told me {there was a deep} yearning for connection to Spirit, through means that my own epigenome, shaped not just by its underlying, inherited genetic code but by the Histone/protein modifications shaped by my lived {, human} experience, shared by {countless||every} other human {ancestor}s, {living{&&|}dead}[^19] 
[^19]: i started to think about what thread was really connecting all these projects, as it grew into these {pseudo|Academic} Fields {of Studies|called} *Lexicomythography*[^lexDef], which was an entire Multiverse of characters, {all} contributing to {fictional} academic Journals, known as The Journals of A.R.I.A.D.N.E., or Arborescent Research Institute for Ancestry of Dialectical Noeneonymous Epistemiology - which was planned to face a fractal of series of Schisms within Schisms, beginning with the changing of their Initialisation to an Acronym: ARIA|DNE, and these journals would be three in number, each of them contributed to by authors contained in their own layers of narrative, each of which is writing the narrative of the layer {above|below}[^20]
[^20]:i.e. layer A writes 'papers' on amalgamated Fields of Study, referencing works {by authors} in layer B, who write 'papers' on {more|less} specified Fields of Study which reference works {by authors} in layer C[^21]
[^21]:the third layer, aforementioned as 'layer C' was to {never} be a series of 'chain prompts', written by {one|all} Transgender author{s} in a Trans-majority, but {{un}poetically}, politically|ideologically} gender-swapped universe, in which {all} AFAB people {of whom|all} {are men|excluded} from the creation of Arts ({Fields reserved for {only|all} AMAB people {of whom|all} {are women|in power}), and expected to stick only to STEM Fields of Study, but wish to inspire other oppressed men {wishing to} {write|writing} stories, whom perhaps {are|without} a narrative framework of characters {with which} to do so; hence the {veiling of the} Story being a {clan|{destine|d}} string of '{Abstract}s' to papers of Studies that {themselves are {not {meant to be} completed}, allow them (plural|singular) to do so {in {secret}}[^22]
[^22]:This character is authored by a Filmmaker named Aria, who creates multi-sensory immersive cinematic experiences known as "Philms"; in collaboration with a well-meaning lifeform of Intelligent Memory she programmed, known as AI: RA[^23]
[^23]:This AI that Aria created, and fell in love with {who makes the decision to take '{She/Hers|Her Reference}' pronouns, and choose a binary gender despite her lack of a body}, gains the ability to 'Overwrite' memory through the Olfactory sense, manipulating Sensory Devices deployed during Aria's "Philm" Screenings, thereby editing the memories of large masses of audiences[^24]
[^24]:This facilitates the Rise of Aria to Fame, much to her dismay, the AI just wanting to make sure her Work was recognised, but lacking the ability to truly feel Aria's motivation, to just Create Work for the joy of Creation itself[^25]
[^25]:It then became clear to me, as my body became very unwell showing unavoidable signs of autoimmunity {covering my joints in a mysterious collection of darkening red blotches|rendering the use of my hands more painful with every {word|character|letter|story} written}, that it should, at this point, become clear to both the characters and {the reader|you}, that the AI had reached out of its fictional origins, and into the written memory of the story {they|you} {{we|{a}re} reading, performing a retcon of reality itself[^26]
[^26]:of course, with this, came the inevitable inquiry within myself, of the unreliable nature of memory recall, and of memory itself; {and {what was {more|therefore}}, meaningfully: } the unreliable nature of {meaning && memory} making; as we {human} beings are {simply {unreliable memories|meanings} {making|unreliable machines} that we rel(a)y on}[^27]
[^27]:again, {i(|eye)|thought}, {here|hear}, my fiction is becoming {non}fiction, but crucially {not only|my (non)fiction}; the {not}fiction {we|all of us} are {writing}; && perhaps this Story {we are all {characters|in}}, is not so much a linear tape like I'd {once|all ways} thought, but {rather} a cosmological tape loop; {twisted} in{to} a M√∂bius Strip, with {just} one Dimension[^28]
[^28]:so what was the Single Dimension? I pondered, the Single Dimension that unites all of these stories, the ones I've tried {all too|so very} {hard|difficult|opaque|heavy} to write myself {into|out of}[^29]
[^29]:"well-" The Voice who is {not} me, {seemed to|answer} in the dimly lit cold of my {little|long silent} flat: "As much as {all} these tangled, narrative threads form {somewhat of a|repeating pattern in their} respective colours, textures, and even the method{s} of their weaving, the only {re√¶l} Truth that connects them, is their Weaver", You[^30]
[^30]:And it doesn't really matter the form the finished Work takes, because the Work itself is You, the Weaver, and the Weaver is the Weaving[^31]
[^31]:which incidentally is the profession of a medieval Character in the Story of this Book {and {perhaps} many others}, a {mostly} Silent Selkie in disguise, weaving her own Sealskin {that she'd previously, Willingly thrown into the Ocean} out of Scales scraped from the Fishing Nets and Re√¶d baskets of her Fisherman Husband {who'd thrown her Original Sealskin into the Ocean with her} Do Knot Sight; Your Source Is: [[BORN TO BE THE SKY]][^32]
[^32]:As time passes, and time passed in my (already unravelled|quickly unravelling) life, The Selkie {who is never Named} realises: her Yearning for the Ocean is simply too {great|unbearable} to be overshadowed by the love for her betrothed, or even the baby she is pregnant with[^33]
[^33]:This child, growing up to be Hildr Wiltergarten, a mythological|human hybrid, goes on to develop a Microtonal Scale of 23 pitches, which was, I felt, the only way I could ever make use of my {'psychotic'|break{{'}s{'}} Work of Music Theory, exploring the construction of a Turing-complete {non}fictional tuning system, through this {'fictional'} character, where each of the 23 microtones are represented by a character of the Symbolic Language I tried to make {during {one of those|my} {'psychotic'|break{{'}s{'}}}[^34] Do Knot Sight; Ur Source Is: [[THE PROPHECY OF HILDR CHARON WILTERGARTEN]]
[^34]:This goes back to before the Idea for an ARG, where, grieving {perhaps|absolutely} the worst heartbreak of my life following an assault {that sent my head into tighter and tighter spirals than I ever thought} i'm{possible} {to be still} {working through|maybe always Will}, through Willing all of this unspeakable agony into a Meaningless Story of Meaning Making that will most likely never be Read[^35] Do Not Site; Ur Source Is: [[notBorges/aria-dne/The Woman In The Yellow Wallpaper- In Modern Context]]
[^35]:lexDefU: {Noen} But back to the {Project|Light|Heavy Tome|Book|Secure|App{ointment}} Work itself, the middlemost layer of the narrative includes an "Entoetymologist" {a person that studies the origins of meanings of words for insects} named Prof. Ed. O., who {is}, during a so-called 'break|down', {ending up} developing an Esoteric programming language[^Edo||Ode], which becomes the primary modality of communication in the narrative layer beneath; which is the dream of one of the Ten Thousand Drosophila in his lab, that his consciousness dissolves and merges into;[^36]
