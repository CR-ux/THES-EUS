[^reach]: to forgive the characters is to understand that we are all reaching ever-closer to a truth that simply cannot be reached for; and the characters of our alphabets can't all be translated exactly accurately, but somehow we manage to understand each other's overlapping meanings, and that's what makes it forgivable in its insufficiency.[^ins]

[^bc]: Because forgiving the characters is easier when you have another character in the story to work together in forgiving each other.[^other]
