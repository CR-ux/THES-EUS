[[notBorges/aria-dne/I|I]]  [[know ]] [[Knot]] what [[I]] have done.

But, perhaps in spite of myself, 
I will continue to do it.

My name is Callie Rose Petal, 
	A Multidisciplinary Creator not known as Borges
	or [<sup>not</sup>Borges](https://notborges.bandcamp.com/)
	
and Researcher in the Field of Lexicomythograpy[^m] 
A thankless and frankly unforgivable task.[^l]



[[The Discovery|What follows is an archival documentation of my encounters with the covert society known as ARIA|DNE, and the art{i.e.}facts I have been able to gather.]][^aa]




Abandon

All Ye Who Enter

And Please,
Forgive me

[^or]:Forgive the characters of the languages we each have been born with and willed ourselves into learning to connect to more of ourselves or maybe invented some for the joy of making music with words or- forgive ourselves.[^fo]
[^fo]: and the characters we write, of ourselves | of ourselves in every one else we think we can't forgive.[^cf]

[^reach]: to forgive the characters is to understand that we are all reaching ever-closer to a truth that simply cannot be reached for; and the characters of our alphabets can't all be translated exactly accurately, but somehow we manage to understand each other's overlapping meanings, and that's what makes it forgivable in its insufficiency.[^ins]
[^ins]: is its capability to overlap, even if crudely; maybe even better if crudely because:[^bc]
[^bc]: Because forgiving the characters is easier when you have another character in the story to work together in forgiving each other.[^other]
[^other]: and when things don't translate properly, that forces much harder contemplative work in order to understand it- which requires a team.[^fict]
[^fict]: and forgiving the insufficiency and yet crucial importance of the characters, of a language, of language itself, and of the characters in every story in every language including the non-fictional ones;[^fm]
