		-Not Borges

poison Ore, Boxes in Boxes, Borges would have been so proud of us my Sweet Mahler, 
Until then, I will Be, Loving You 






it is vitally important that i tell you how unimportant it is that you're reading this or {k}not 
{Shæ'l} Eye'll, held open, unheld hell did open, oh hell did it grab me, lashed me, I last past catastrophe batted flight eyelash waits weighted and weight against gravity--
I'll keep writing anyway until my fingers break

I think about Dis Pater again and Dystonia and how Rachmaninoff's hands slowly curled in on themselves and slowly, slowly dragged his handspan to a normal, non-deified octave or so 

and Borges going blind and seeing only Yellow and I think, Christ, I cannot stop thinking about that dream with the fucking Yellow Telephone. 

Is it past 9PM now? Have I been supposed to plug it in? ALL I'VE EVER BEEN DOING IN MY INCESSANT LINE-CUTTING IS TRYING TO PLUG THE FUCKING THING IN Haven't I plugged it in now? Is that what this was? Speaking to everyone or Trying just Trying to For Get ? jst Trying please dear God just let these words be some sort of spell that I simply don't understand or try to pretend to understand anymore but dear God in where the fuck ever which literally means everywhere inside all the Words: Please. I'd like to stop hurting now and for my body to stop carrying all of the hurt that it keeps seeing in every reflective drop of rain and fog across each and every mountain so PLEASE. I give up, in the most reverently defiant way, as in, I give up wanting to fucking die, I don't want to fucking die and that's the ironic thing about all this finally my body feels like it's becoming my own and it may well be in its final chapter and I haven't even WRITTEN the Final Act of The Story Just another fucking cosmic ocean of subconscious electrical organic red, red, unringed parallel currents of one way streets limiting traffic in its heading in opposite directions but 
but they are going into one another at least 
that's Left, right? 
well, your house is on the Left of me, Right now, as I look at the angel 
We'll, Yore-- How Sis, on the Left of Me, Write. Now. As I Look at the Angel 
Welly, Ore House Eye: Sun the Left of Me. Righten Our Hours. I Look at The Angel. 



too much time has passed and i realise i have not defined the titular lexicomythographic proverb 'to forgive the characters', to which the Title of the Woman in the Avian Genomics Paper[^genomics] Written In The Wallpaper Written by the Writer of this Paper which isn't paper but still a Letter which is W which is for Wiltergarten, Who, Where Whence Wilderness Wove, Wills Weaving With Words Which Wire Woeful Waves With Which We Wear Wrapped When Worn Weary, Which is the Witch to which this Witch was referring, as in, as a Sin, the Original Sin of seeing ones own nakedness, One's Own Shame in So Oppositional Other, Or: mis en abysmal nakedness. 
Mis[^M]
en[^E]
abysmal[^A]
nakedness[^N]
imitating[^I]
nesting [^nest]
god[^g]


For fuck sake I still haven't defined the prodverb, which is the lexDef of a proverb which alerts the reader to a narrative point of mythopoeic / vulnerable importance. like a drop stitch of knitting being a way out of a labyrinth 


but i mustn't 
go in there

so to forgive the characters means 

to acknowledge and understand 
and forgive 
language's insufficiency in portraying meaning 
and language, in the broadest sense. Meaning:

Meaning.

forgive meaning, of its insufficiency to truly portray the weight of itself 

forgive the characters of the languages we each have been born with and willed ourselves into learning to connect to more of ourselves or maybe invented some for the joy of making music with words or-

forgive ourselves.
and the characters we write, of ourselves 
of ourselves in every one else we think we can't forgive -

and that has a forgivable character, but, forgiving-

it has Nine Characters. 

so does this story {all of it | them}


to forgive the characters is to understand that we are all reaching ever-closer to a truth that simply cannot be reached for; and the characters of our alphabets can't all be translated exactly accurately, but somehow we manage to understand each other's overlapping meanings, and that's what makes it forgivable in its insufficiency. is its capability to overlap, even if crudely; maybe even better if crudely because:

Because forgiving the characters is easier when you have another character in the story to work together in forgiving each other. 

and when things don't translate properly, that forces much harder contemplative work in order to understand it-

(very 'arrival',)

which requires a team 

and forgiving the insufficiency and yet crucial importance of the characters, of a language, of language itself, and of the characters in every story in every language including the non-fictional ones; 

that is what meaning is; 
that is what it means; 
to forgive the characters
