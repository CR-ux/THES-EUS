METACOMMENTARY
===
A NOTE TO THE EDITOR:
In this rose cross-sectional analysis, spanning multitudinous dimensions woven through a single point[^Knot] in time, I explore the device[^machine] of language, and many (not all) of the variations of its derived narrative devices, to provide a (perhaps divisive) commentary on the nature of Meaning, when left to its own devices. The narrator of these "Letters" wished to tell me something in order for it to subsequently (potentially) propagate, or (differently put) diffuse, into your Memory; but, for the Life of me, I neither remember, nor mean to forget it. I pray the narrator may remember that I indeed meant something to him once, and that, while necessarily making mincemeat of his meaningfully metastructured meanderings through a metaphysical, mitotic landscape of memetic mindfulness, I mean to make a memorandum, which means, to make a point through compiling a short written report, (which many may mean to get round to, but never actually, read) or write a message, a singularity of meaning through multiplicity of meanings contained in characters in letters and letters to characters in letters of a certain character for the purposes of letting a character get a word in edgeways - this means, the medium through which I mean to make contact, or the message[^medium] I mean to metastasise via such means, are as follows:

In Knots, as was canonical during my toiling over his Works, I closed one of the duplicated tabs of the bookmarked page on Noet. Borges' '*Letters:-'* [^N.B.]
As we all may or may not know by now, Gnosis is the contemporary word denoting 'deep wisdom', or rather, as coined by Noet. Borges in antiquity, 'Knosis', is the denotation awarded to the contemplative practice of omitting all spoken words, otherwise known as 'Observing Silence'. 
Thoughts on the subject are split, as matter, as to whether the ancient praxis of *Bookbinding*[^lexDef0] when used in its demarkation pertaining to the Word, applies to the Art of Writing, or whether 'Silence' in this matter refers only to Sonic Resonance, and not the propagation of Semantic Resonance as a unified whole. Knostic Scholars have, understandably, been unforgivably silent on the matter for centuries. 

And so it goes, without saying, that the titular 'Letters' to which The Never Wholly One To Once-Twice Then Thrice Then Tens of Thousandths Great Noet. Borges was referring in his Magus Opus, were not a collection of epistolary accounts of correspondence (i.e. written 'letters'), but instead, an archival documentation of his encounters with the Divine, through the necessary (though, tragically, suffocating) device of the individual Characters (i.e. letters, written) of All Words (which, he unfortunately consciously realised in his lifetime, were intertwined plots within an intricate Story with just one Character (the ante purposes of which, the anthropomorphised recipient of which, and the morphological basis of which, are all written in this letter)), Himself.


The point of all of this is to make the point that all of it is pointless. Which is to say, We, as Meaning Making Machines, Making Meaning from Memories, themselves Making Machines that Make Meaning from Memory. In meaningless adventures such as these, I have spoiled and wasted all my years. However, if I'd like to take One Memory with me into the Great Library, it is this:

The singularity, or point, which is the causal, pluripotent stem cell from which all of our endless self-same complexities of Memory and Meaning are supposed to have differentiated, has no real 'point'. Rather, its point, and my point, which I'm struggling to point towards, which is the point of struggling, is that it is not even the Making of the Point that is Meaningful. Not even the Meaning of the Memory that the Point points towards. Instead, the Point is the word Making, placed *before* the word "Point" - if you read the Characters of the words in reverse, or, in hindsight, on average, taking a mean from the meanings I derived from all of my inherited, regurgitated and re-remembered memories; what was the point? I'm really not being mean here, I only wish, in the realest sense, to use the sense and anti-sense strands of the DNA triple helix[^triskelion] to remind you of what you were meant to forget. I mean, we are ourselves limited-capacity memory machines made by meaning, who are making not memories but manufacturing meaning-memory|manuscript-material molecules. This Noetic 'dust' falls upon deine kleine Klein Wunderhorn[^Mahler], its very cumulation causing a Brahmanic 'Sneeze'[^Jung], momentarily, due to the underlying concept of deific auto-immunity, whereby a Deity's incorporeal form mounts a cosmological immune response against self-molecules; allowing for clergical promotion within Babel. 

To get back to my point, I never can, or Will, which means absolutely Every Thing to me. 

We are Meaning Making Machines
We are Memory Making Machines 
We are Meaning and Memory Making Machines
We Are, Meaning and Memory, Making Machines 
We, Are, Meaning and Memory Machines, 
We Are Memories Made by our Meaning, 
We Are Made by the Meaning of Memory,
We, Are, Machines in the Making 
Meaning:
We Are
Making
