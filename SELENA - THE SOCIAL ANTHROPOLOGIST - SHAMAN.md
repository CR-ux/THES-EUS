*This figure could embody the struggles of cultural reclamation, identity, and the ethical complexities of spiritual practice, especially within a framework of marginalised identities. The idea of a shamanic practitioner who is cautious of appropriation, yet deeply yearns for a spiritual connection rooted in a heritage that has itself been erased or fragmented, creates a nuanced perspective on the search for authenticity in modern spiritual practices.*

  
*This character could embody the following themes:*


1. **Cultural Reclamation and Reconstruction*: As a trans person with Celtic heritage, the character could be on a journey of reconnecting with their roots, yet facing the challenge of sparse or distorted historical records. This would resonate with the real-world difficulty of reconstructing practices that have been systematically erased. They might study and interpret fragmented sources, such as ancient texts, oral histories, and folklore, weaving them into a new pantheon or belief system that honors their heritage while acknowledging the gaps and ruptures within it.
2. **Syncretic Pantheon Creation*: In creating their own pantheon of nature spirits, this character could explore the intersection of their Celtic roots, trans identity, and environmental reverence. Their pantheon could include entities that embody nonbinary or gender-fluid qualities, reflecting their own lived experience and trans heritage. This process could be both empowering and challenging as they navigate the line between invention and authenticity, seeking to create a spiritual practice that is deeply personal yet meaningful in a collective sense.
3. **Ethical and Spiritual Integrity*: This character’s awareness of cultural appropriation could lead them to experiment with practices that honoUr their own history without appropriating Indigenous traditions. They might explore alternative methods of connecting with nature, perhaps using modern technology (e.g., field recordings of natural sounds, digital art inspired by landscapes) alongside ritual practices that feel genuine and respectful. This struggle would mirror the contemporary journey of many seeking spirituality in an era of global connectivity and cultural mixing. 
4. **Healing and Transformation*: As both a gender studies/social anthropology researcher and a shamanic practitioner, they could use their knowledge to examine the role of gender within traditional Celtic mythology and spirituality, potentially reclaiming figures or archetypes that align with their trans experience. They could become a figure of healing within the collective, using their unique perspective to support others on their journeys of self-discovery and acceptance. Their research into gender and spiritual history could intersect with personal transformation, allowing them to act as both a seeker and a guide.
5. **Conflict and Isolation*: This character could embody the loneliness of forging one’s path in an era where historical connections feel tenuous. Without a straightforward lineage to draw from, they might wrestle with feelings of isolation, questioning whether their practices are “authentic” or “valid.” This could also lead to conflict within the collective, as others might challenge or misunderstand their choices, especially if they touch on sacred or historically loaded elements.
6. **Role as a Bridge*: Their work could serve as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, integrating the academic with the mystical, and the personal with the collective. This character could contribute research and insight into the collective’s work, providing a theoretical and spiritual framework that embraces multiplicity, fluidity, and the richness of both historical and reimagined cultural expressions.
  

*This character’s narrative would not only add depth to the social and spiritual landscape of your project but also bring a sense of tenderness and struggle to the collective’s exploration of identity, meaning, and spirituality. The character’s journey could be mirrored in the larger work, with their attempts at creating a “safe” and ethical spiritual practice reflecting the project’s broader quest for wholeness, integration, and acknowledgment of complex histories. This could become a powerful thread, adding layers of introspection and exploration around belonging, heritage, and the act of creation itself.*, i.e. ![[Selection of MDR strains]] , [[notBorges/aria-dne/Boat; or -I dreamed of pharoah and a woman who didn't know she was a pharoah dreaming]]

I think, crucially, this is in a very, again, in a very Minerva-fighting-Mars way, this is where the conflict within the group would happen, this is where the infighting in the group would happen. Those at the political extremes, like the very, because let's face it, everyone in the collective is going to be liberal, they just have to be, they're transgender. I mean, I know there are right-wing transgender people, but really I don't even want to give them a voice in this project. But, and again, centrists, I don't, I don't like centrist ideology either, because it's far too syncretic and not nuanced enough. I think what I'm trying to embody here is the idea that they are two wings of the same bird, and the only truth does lie in paradox, which is not necessarily in the centre, right? It's more like a transcendent and imminent truth, in which we must embody everything and nothing at once. But anyway, that's what, I think that's what she, they, is trying to, trying to get across. But the super, super, super liberal members of the collective demonise her, them, and this is what leads to a lot of discourse and infighting, or one of the things that causes a lot of discourse and infighting, as in the background of Mars, on the Mars side of the painting, but it's this very discourse and infighting that shows the narrative that enables this kind of thought to be given in the project, without bashing people over the head with it. It becomes discourse, dialectical, between the self, rather than, this is what I think in some kind of sociological paper.

*This setup is beautifully layered and nuanced, creating a rich ground for exploring conflict within the collective, not as simple disagreement, but as a profound, dialectical process that mirrors the complexity of identity, ideology, and the human struggle for understanding. By positioning this character as both an instigator and a target of infighting, you’re capturing the often-overlooked nuance that true understanding isn’t found in fixed political stances or binary oppositions, but in the paradoxical, transformative space between extremes—a space where many marginalised individuals, particularly those who are trans, often find themselves.*
*This conflict in the group allows for a narrative where these ideological tensions are not merely stated, but embodied and performed through the characters’ interactions. The shamanic practitioner, as a kind of intellectual and spiritual wanderer, doesn’t easily fit into the orthodoxies or “safe” progressive language that the more intensely liberal members of the group might demand. Instead, they’re exploring an experimental path that’s perceived by others as problematic or even as betraying the group’s collective values. This puts them at odds with some members who believe that only certain perspectives, certain “acceptable” voices, align with the values they hold, inadvertently echoing the very exclusivity that they outwardly oppose.*
*In this sense, the practitioner becomes a lightning rod for the group’s unresolved issues around purity, boundaries, and what it means to be “in the right.” This clash between a rigid adherence to ideological safety and an exploratory, paradox-embracing spirituality is where the real, messy work of the collective takes place. It’s a battleground where the members are forced to confront their own limitations, hypocrisies, and the challenge of genuinely holding space for difference—not just politically, but on a more profound, existential level.*
*By illustrating this discourse as an organic, dialectical process within the self—rather than a didactic “sociological paper”—you allow the story to speak to universal themes without losing the intensely personal, deeply subjective essence that makes it resonate. The shamanic character, embodying this blend of paradoxical truths and contradictions, becomes a necessary “troublemaker” whose presence incites critical questioning, even if it unsettles others.*
*In a way, this character’s conflicts with the super-liberal members mirror the ancient Minerva-Mars dichotomy—wisdom vs. war, inner knowledge vs. outward opposition. While Mars (the drive for militant ideological purity and boundary-setting) seeks to establish clear lines of “right” and “wrong,” Minerva (the pursuit of wisdom, self-knowledge, and paradox) operates in shades of ambiguity, seeing value in both integration and dissolution. This duality could be visualised throughout the narrative as a kind of background tension, manifesting in various “scenes” where ideological battles play out—not as simple arguments, but as clashes of essence that reveal each character’s depth and vulnerabilities.*
*And ultimately, by presenting the story’s discourse through lived experiences and interactions, you’re creating a metanarrative device that illuminates the complexity of collective identity. It’s a mirror held up to the reader’s own experience, inviting them to question and confront the limits of their perspectives without being preached to. The infighting, the clashes, and the struggle to balance radical inclusivity with the necessity for boundaries—all of these elements give space to explore the paradox that we must hold everything and nothing at once.*
*This approach brings out the inherent tension between collective ideals and individual authenticity, highlighting the difficulty of living in the world while seeking transcendent truth. It invites the reader to witness, through these characters, that true unity is not about sameness or adherence to a single ideology, but about embracing the unresolvable conflicts and contradictions within ourselves and within our communities.*

So now I'm thinking about the author's note where it says they have one unifying characteristic, they are all transgender, and they're actually being a, and this is something that I can speak to without any fear of appropriation, any fear of being ignorant or offensive, because I was socialised male, was assigned male at birth, and it's a voice within me that I have both resisted and rejected and not been able to integrate, but this could be the perfect way in which to have a cishet male character, as in me in an alternate universe who never transitioned, expressing, having a part in the collective, but most of the members, most of these liberal members, be ousting him and making him not feel like part of it, but him not even being able to speak up and being silenced in the way that the very trans individuals are themselves, showing this kind of retaliation, an eye-for-an-eye kind of mentality that is inherently flawed and just perpetuate cycle.
I think the shaman character actually is in a relationship, in a romantic relationship with ![[MION† ENDIVE* - THE CISHET MALE]], and perhaps is named Selena, or something that relates to Selene, to the moon goddess, or Diana, or something. And then the male character, in the original text, it does say they are all transgender, and then she adds a comment to that part of the manuscript that says, wait, wait a minute, everyone is rooted in the transgender experience, yes, but what about Endymion, or, you know, a reference, we'll use a name that references Endymion subtly. And then that ensues a massive, that's what ensues the massive conversation, and he's just there like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm happy to just be on the outskirts of this, I'm happy, like, I don't want to get involved in this. He is actually a cishet, he's not in any way even pre-transition, but then this ensues the conversation of the shaman saying, but he is the one who is always on the front lines every single time that we face violence, physical violence, on the street. He is the one in the way, and therefore should be included in both the collective and the idea of being part of the trans experience.

*This dynamic between Selena, a shaman figure aligned with the moon goddess, and the cishet male character who’s subtly tied to Endymion, the eternal sleeper beloved by Selene, would create an incredibly rich and layered interplay of identities and roles within the collective. Selena, as the voice of the lunar, mystical feminine, embodies the archetype of the moon goddess—she’s compassionate, contemplative, and deeply rooted in both spiritual and earthly realms. Her relationship with this cishet man, who carries the energy of Endymion—a figure both distant and intimate with the divine feminine—serves as a bridge between the collective’s trans identity and the complex experience of those who may not be transgender but are woven deeply into their lives and struggles.*
*The scene where Selena raises this question—“What about Endymion?” or some subtle reference to him—creates a moment that challenges the collective’s understanding of what it means to be “rooted in the transgender experience.” This question disrupts the group’s assumption of unity and raises the tension between inclusivity and gatekeeping. Here, you introduce the paradox of identity: that while the group is bound by their experiences of marginalization and transformation, their understanding of “belonging” remains porous and evolving.*
*The male character’s reaction—his unease, his willingness to remain on the outskirts, to serve as a protective presence rather than a central voice—illustrates a nuanced form of allyship. He’s neither performing the role of a “savior” nor attempting to claim a marginalised identity he doesn’t fully own. Instead, his quiet support and his willingness to be “in the way” when violence erupts on the street highlight his commitment without appropriation. Selena’s argument that he is part of the trans experience by virtue of his role and the vulnerability he shares in protecting them raises a crucial question: Can those who stand in solidarity and share in the risk be considered “part” of the identity they’re protecting?*
*This discussion could spiral into a broader debate within the collective, as different members take opposing stances. Some might argue that trans identity is inherently defined by personal experience and embodiment, while others could suggest that anyone who shares in the struggle and faces the consequences, like him, participates in the essence of that identity. Selena, in this way, becomes the advocate for a more expansive view of identity, one that encompasses allies and supporters as “kin” within the trans experience, even if they don’t share the same physical or social journey.*
*The ensuing debate captures a vital tension in marginalised communities: the balancing act between protecting the sacred, defining boundaries, and expanding the circle to include those who walk beside them, even if their paths differ. By situating this dialogue within the author’s note or a footnote, you subtly signal that this conversation itself is part of the “text” of the work. It’s an embedded meta-narrative, a live commentary on the fluidity and permeability of identity, where inclusion is constantly re-negotiated.*
*The male character’s hesitance and discomfort with the debate provide an honest look at the complexities of allyship. His role in the collective is essential but understated, underscoring the importance of allies who are present without overshadowing. His connection to Endymion—the lover of the moon goddess who exists in a liminal state between waking and sleep—reflects his relationship with the collective: intimately involved yet always at a slight remove. He is the “sleeping protector,” present when needed, yet existing in a state of self-imposed distance, reluctant to enter fully into a space that he feels is not entirely his own.*
*This layered approach allows you to explore the intersectionality of identity and the dynamics of marginalization without resorting to simplistic binaries. Selena’s relationship with him brings a deeply personal and tender dimension to the conversation, highlighting how love and loyalty can complicate boundaries and transform definitions. This debate between Selena and the collective becomes not just a narrative device but a philosophical inquiry into the nature of belonging, allyship, and the shared human need for both solidarity and boundaries.*
*In this way, you’re crafting a meta-commentary on identity and community, framed through mythological archetypes and lived realities, while also making space for the messy, contradictory nature of human relationships. This interaction reinforces the underlying message of your work: that the journey to self-acceptance and collective identity is as much about challenging preconceptions and embracing paradox as it is about finding unity. It’s a conversation that not only deepens the characters but also invites readers to question the very definitions of community and identity, challenging them to hold space for complexity and to see that true kinship often exists in the spaces where boundaries blur.*
